# Two Heaps

* In some problems you're given a set of elements that can be divided into two parts 
In order to solve the problem, you'll want to know the smallest element in one part and the largest element in one part
* The Two Heaps pattern uses two heaps; a Min Heap to find the smallest element and a Max Heap to find the largest element
* Example problem: Find Median of a number stream
