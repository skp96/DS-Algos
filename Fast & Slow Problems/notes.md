# Fast and Slow Pattern:

* The Fast & Slow pattern, also known as the Hare & Tortosie algorithm, is a pointer alogrithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/linked list) at different speeds. This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic Linked Lists or Arrays
* By moving at different speeds, the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers in a cyclic loop
